# Development Process

Note that step 2 and 3 occurred simultaneously in a back and forth iterative fashion, as the core functionality served as the baseline for the tests.

1. Ideation (CLI blueprint & blueprint shell scripts)
    - CLI blueprint: Specific actions and ideation of functionality that it should support
    - Shell Script: Building on what I concluded in the previous stage, being the phase where I came up with the blueprint, I then envisioned how shell scripts would interact with this repository. This is a way of getting a more tangible and concrete understanding of how it would look like interacting with the tool

2. Setup (Folder structure & Tests)
    - Setup the main folders and files, such that it makes inituitive sense and to get an understanding of how exactly this repository would accommodate for the functionality I concluded in the previous ideation phase (backend logic)
    - Setting up tools for code compliance and tests, serving as a continuous basis in which I can evaluate my code quality, utilizing linting, formatting and type checks.


3. Core (Functionality & Unit tests)
    - The main features of the repository
    - The isolated tests for each feature

4. CI Pipeline

5. Future Extensions
