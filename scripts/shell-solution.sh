##  SHELL SOLUTION  ##
#
# -  This script is my shell implementation of this project, as opposed to using Python



# TODO:
# -  Parse .yaml file
# -  Iterate through services
# -  Check status of each service


# REMINDER: Import/source log-aggregation.sh functions for the current service in the loop
